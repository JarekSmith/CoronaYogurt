            <h2>Horror Modpack</h2>
            <h3>12/14/2025</h3>
            <p>If you're here, you're probably looking to download the modpack we're playing right now!</p>
            <a href="downloads/Cave Horror Project 1 Heehee-v3.1.3.zip" download><img src="images2/download.gif"></a>
            <p>Once you download the modpack, open Curseforge and click <strong>Import +</strong>. It should then let 
                you choose a .zip file; upload the modpack. Curseforge should handle the rest!</p>
            <p>Alternatively, if the code is still working, you can try to import using the code <strong>zGtJCwS2</strong>.
            It expires after 7 days, so don't count on it for long!</p>

            <h2>Five Nights at Freddy's 2</h2>
            <h3>12/13/2025</h3>
            <p>Just watched the FNAF2 movie!</p>
            <p>I'm just going to preface, it's not a very good movie. If you're looking to hoot and holler at "peak cinema,"
                the FNAF2 movie is probably not going to be what you're looking for. However, it <i>is</i> pretty <i>cool</i>.
                I'd kind of compare it to those old monster versus movies--it doesn't have a groundbreaking story or anything
                that's going to make you FEEL a certain way, but it's pretty darn fun to watch these robots do stuff and be
                dangerous.</p>
            <p>The fact that they're all practical (as far as I know) makes for a fun watch. They have a presence wherever they go.
                Watching a movie where the characters are talking to what's clearly CGI always takes me out of it, I can't just not
                imagine them talking to an empty room.
            </p>
            <p>It's packed full of references that's sure to make your 12-year-old son/daughter chortle with glee. <i>Definitely</i> consider
            taking your child out to see this film if you need some brownie points with them, they'll love you for it.</p>
            <p>Overall, I'd give the Five Nights at Freddy's 2 movie a solid 2.5/5 stars. Not a terrible movie, pretty enjoyable as far
                as video game movies go, but nothing to write home about.
            </p>

            <h2>On the death of spinning Goku</h2>
            <h3>12/5/2025</h3>
            <p>It is with a heavy heart that I must announce the passing of our old friend, gokuspin2.gif.</p>
            <img id="goku-spin" src="images2/gokuspin2.gif" style="filter: grayscale(100%); max-width: 320px; min-height: 256px;" onclick="toggleKojima()">
            <p>He was found dead in his home on October 12th, 2025. While the cause of death is unknown, foul play has been
                ruled out as a possibility. We would like to ask the members of this community to cherish his memory and
                remember him well.</p>
            <p>In somewhat related news, an auction will be held on December 25th, 2025. With no next of kin, the state has
                decided to sell off his belongings in order to repay his outstanding debts and unpaid taxes. Hope to see you there!
